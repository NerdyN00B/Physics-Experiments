# DMM

This software provides support for the TTi 1906 and Rigol DM3058E digital multimeter.

## Testing

The software can be tested automatically by connecting a DMM to the TOO DMM Test Box. It is recommended to only connect
one DMM of a type to the computer. To run the tests for the specific DMMs use the bundled run scripts in PyCharm.
